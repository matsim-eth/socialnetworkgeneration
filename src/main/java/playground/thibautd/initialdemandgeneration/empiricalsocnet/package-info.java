/**
 * This package implements the approach used to generate realistic large scale social networks presented in chapter 5 of <a href="https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000165685">this dissertation</a>.
 * It contains both a "framework" designed for the general case, and an implementation of that framework for a particular data set sampled using "snowball sampling".
 * The best entry point to the code is {@link playground.thibautd.initialdemandgeneration.empiricalsocnet.snowball.RunSimpleCliquesSampling}
